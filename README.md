# End-to-End CI/CD Implementation with Jenkins

## Overview

This project demonstrates an automated CI/CD pipeline implementation for a Python-based application using Jenkins. The goal is to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery through automation. The pipeline integrates various tools, including Jenkins, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and GitHub, along with webhooks for seamless automation.

## Features

- Automated CI/CD pipeline for Python-based applications.
- Integration of Jenkins, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and GitHub.
- Webhook configuration for continuous automation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

- Jenkins
- AWS 
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git and GitHub

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Configure Jenkins:

    - Install required plugins.
    - Set up Jenkins credentials for AWS, Docker, and GitHub.

3. Configure AWS:

    - Set up AWS credentials with sufficient permissions.

4. Configure Docker:

    - Ensure Docker is installed and running.
    - Set up Docker credentials if using a private registry.

5. Configure Kubernetes:

    - Set up Kubernetes cluster(minikube) and configure `kubectl`.

6. Configure Git and GitHub:

    - Generate GitHub tokens for Jenkins and add them to your Jenkins Credentials.

7. Configure Webhooks:

    - Set up webhooks in Jenkins for GitHub to trigger the pipeline on code changes.

## Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` at the root of the repository. This pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Checkout:** Fetches the latest code from the GitHub repository.

2. **Build:** Builds the Python application.

3. **Dockerize:** Builds a Docker image of the application.

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes:** Deploy the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage

1. Push changes to the GitHub repository.

2. Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline through webhooks.

3. Monitor the Jenkins dashboard for pipeline execution and results.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to the following:

- Jenkins build logs.
- AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes logs and error messages.
