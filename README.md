# End-To-End CI/CD Implementation â€“ Jenkins

## Overview

This project demonstrates an automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Python-based application using Jenkins. The goal is to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery through automation. The pipeline is designed to seamlessly integrate various tools such as Jenkins, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and GitHub.

## Features

- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented a robust end-to-end pipeline for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Tool Integration**: Effectively integrated and configured the following tools:
  - **Jenkins**: As the core automation server managing the pipeline.
  - **AWS**: Utilized cloud services for deployment and infrastructure management.
  - **Docker**: Used for containerization of the application, ensuring consistency across environments.
  - **Kubernetes**: Orchestrated containerized applications for scalable and reliable deployments.
  - **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaboration for source code management.
  - **Webhooks**: Implemented webhooks for seamless automation, enabling triggered builds and deployments.
